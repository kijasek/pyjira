                 Command-Line Interface for daily JIRA tasks

As a software developer I use JIRA everyday to:

  -- assign task to me and star working on it
  -- see task details
  -- see all tasks that are assign to me
  -- view task ID for commit messages
  -- resolve task as fixed or implemented
  -- add worklog to the task that I am currently working on

If I am programming in Java, I can use Eclipse with Mylyn. That works great. 
However, when I am programming in C, JavaScript or Python using Vim I need to
switch to JIRA's web interface. That's inefficient. 

Pyjira is used by me now to do basic JIRA tasks straight from command line.
